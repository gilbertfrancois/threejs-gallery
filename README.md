# Three.js template
_Gilbert Fran√ßois Duivesteijn_



## About

This template is a minimum starting point for a React - Three.js web project. 
Some features of the template:
- Shows how to pass React state variables to the THREE.js sketch.
- Has a constructor and destructor of the WebGL renderer, avoiding potential
memory leaks.
- Proper window resize handling.
- Boiler plate code for a GUI panel for testing.

The THREE.js sample sketch is inspired from the great work of _Yuri Artiukh_.
